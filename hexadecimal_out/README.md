For this exercise, you need to write a program that takes a hex number and returns the decimal equivalent. That is, if the user enters 50, then we will assume that it is a hex number (equal to 0x50), and will print the value 80 on the screen. And no, you shouldn’t convert the number all at once using the int function, although it is permissible to use int one digit at a time.

This exercise isn’t meant to test your math skills; not only can you get the hex equivalent of integers with the hex function, but most people don’t even need that in their day-to-day lives. However, this does touch upon the conversion (in various ways) across types that we can do in Python, thanks to the fact that sequences (e.g., strings) are iterable. Consider also the builtin functions that we can use to solve this problem even more easily than if we had to write things from scratch.
