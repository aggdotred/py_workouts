The challenge here is to write a mysum function that does the same thing as the built-in sum function. However, instead of taking a single sequence as a parameter, it should take a variable number of arguments. Thus while we might invoke sum([1,2,3]), we would instead invoke mysum(1,2,3) or mysum(10,20,30,40,50).
